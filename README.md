## How to compile our Project
To compile our project simply go into the basedirectory and run:  
1. `ant clean`  
2. `ant deploy`

This creates an executable `.jar` file in the basedirectory.

Ant should use the buildfile `built.xml` by default

## How to run our project
In the basedirectory call:

`java -jar Phteven.jar hostname portno`

where `hostname` is the address of the server and `portno` is the port number.

## Our maps
Our map files can be found in the folder `maps`
